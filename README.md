# AI CODE REVIEWER - A webpage to review your code and correct it.


This project is a minimal full-stack application that provides an interactive web UI for automated code review. Users can paste their source code into a code editor and receive an AI-generated review powered by the Google Gemini model (gemini-2.5-flash). This application demonstrates a clean, end-to-end integration of a modern Large Language Model (LLM) into a web application, showcasing both front-end and back-end development best practices.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React 19** A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite** A lightning-fast build tool that significantly improves the development experience.
- **react-simple-code-editor** & **Prism.js** For providing a lightweight, functional code editor with syntax highlighting.
- **react-markdown** & **rehype-highlight** To beautifully render the markdown-formatted AI review with syntax highlighting for code snippets.
- **Axios** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.

### Backend:
- **Express.js** A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Google Generative AI SDK (@google/generative-ai)** The official library for interacting with the Google Gemini API.
- **dotenv** To manage environment variables securely, particularly for the Gemini API key.
- **Vercel CLI:** The server is configured for seamless serverless deployment on Vercel.
