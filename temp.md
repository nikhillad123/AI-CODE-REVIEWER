Okay, let's review this.

❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum () { return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ **Undefined Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope, nor are they passed
as parameters. This will lead to a `ReferenceError` when the function is called.
* ❌ **Lack of Parameters:** For a `sum` function, it's a fundamental best practice to take the numbers to be summed as
explicit parameters, making the function reusable and predictable.
* ❌ **Implicit Global Dependency:** Relying on global variables (`a` and `b` if they were defined globally) is generally
bad practice as it makes code harder to understand, test, and maintain.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(sum(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ **Clear Parameters:** `a` and `b` are now explicitly defined as parameters, making the function's inputs clear and
preventing `ReferenceError`.
* ✔ **Reusability:** The function can now be called with any two numbers, making it highly reusable.
* ✔ **Predictable Behavior:** The function's output depends solely on its inputs, making it easier to reason about and
test.
* ✔ **Documentation:** Added a JSDoc block to explain what the function does, its parameters, and what it returns,
improving maintainability and understanding for other developers (or your future self!).
